information is represented inside the computer using tiny electrical signals going on and off at mind-boggling speeds
use circuits to do everything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds.

# Hardware and Software

 basically, it’s what you see inside your computer, from circuts to wires to speaekers to plugs and whatnot. So then, what is software? it’s what you don’t see, it’s the code and the apps and the programs, you can’t see the code, only the result of it on the hardware.

  # Circuits and Logic
there are two types of codes that computers can understand , **zero for false and one for true** .
 When logic gates are connected they form a circuit. Logic circuits are designed to perform a particular function, understanding the nature of that function requires a logic circuit truth table.
