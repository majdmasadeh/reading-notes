A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, ** especially the text that you write to build a web site. **

The Featurs of Text Editor
1- code completion
Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

2- Syntax highlighting
is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text

3- series of themes
A themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.

4- Extensions
Extensions are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldnâ€™t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality as you need it.

The following are common extensions:

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
