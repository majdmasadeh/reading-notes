# Links

* What about links in HTML?

## Links
- Creating links between pages
- Linking to other sites
- Email links

- Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything between the opening a tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

#  layout
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- block-level element. -Examples include: h1 /p/ ul/ li
- Inline-level element.
* Examples include: 
When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

# JavaScript
## Functions 
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

* Function Syntax  

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). 
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). 
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, …)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times. 
You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

# Reasons for Pair Programming
1- Greater efficiency
2- Engaged collaboration
3- Learning from fellow students
4- Social skills
5- Job interview readiness
6- Work environment readiness

## How does pair programming work?

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. but should not be writing any code.
