A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.

Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:

1- Access the content of the page
2- Modify the content of the page
3- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
4- React to events triggered by the user or browser

## functions

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
