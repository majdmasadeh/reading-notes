* What is Git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

* Why Git?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to

## Example :
git clone [url] This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.
