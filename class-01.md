   introducing a new set of elemnts that help define a structure of a page . the new html5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. its provide clearer code , the old one do not understand html5 elements need to be told which elemnts are block level elemnts .
   traditional html layouts:
   1- Headers & Footers: The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:

The main header or footer appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.
2- Navigation: The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

3- Articles: The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

4- Sections: The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

    how you add a page and control with width and hight .


## The several tags in HTML:
1- DOCCTYPEs: Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using

2- Comments in HTML: If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser, you can add the text between these characters. .

3- ID Attribute: Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore.

4- Block Elements: Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block-level elements. Examples of block elements are h1, p, ul, and li.

5- Inline Elements: Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements. These are known as inline elements. Examples of inline elements are <>, <**> .

## ABC of Programming:
Before learning how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, we need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:
  
  ## What is a script and how do I create one?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal and to write a script, we need to first state our goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.


  ## How do I write a script for a web page?


It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

# Process and Design:

* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
