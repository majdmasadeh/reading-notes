## For Loops
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

## while loop
if you dont know how many time the code should run , you can use a while loop,the condition can be something other than a counterto loop the condition is true. while (i < 10) { text += “The number is “ + i; i++; ## Do while: similar to while ,but has one key difference always run the the statement ,inside the curly braces at least once ,even if the condition evalutes to fales.
