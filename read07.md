# CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

*CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.*

## Using External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.

## Using Inernal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the style tag element, inside the head section.

## Color:
** Foreground Color:**
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

1- RGB values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

2- hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green, and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #sign. For example: #ee3e80

3- color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.

** Background Color:**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box, You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors, If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.
